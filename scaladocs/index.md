Here are the Scaladocs for the
[emblem](https://github.com/sullivan-/emblem/wiki)
[longevity](http://sullivan-.github.io/longevity/) projects. I'm only
publishing released versions at this point. If you want something from
`HEAD`, you can generate them yourself pretty easily: run `sbt
"project emblem" doc` or `sbt "project longevity" doc`.

Scaladocs for the latest release can be found here:

- [longevity API](longevity-latest)
- [emblem API](emblem-latest)

Scaladocs per release:

- [longevity 0.2.0 API](longevity-0.2.0)
- [emblem 0.2.0 API](emblem-0.2.0)
