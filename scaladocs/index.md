Here are the Scaladocs for the
[emblem](https://github.com/sullivan-/emblem/wiki)
[longevity](http://sullivan-.github.io/longevity/) projects. I'm
currently generating these manually off of `HEAD`. they were last
generated on October 9th, 2015.

In the future, I'll put in API docs for release versions, and try to
set up an autopublish on new commits.

- [longevity API](longevity-latest)
- [emblem API](emblem-latest)
