Longevity has two [Lightbend
Activator](https://www.lightbend.com/community/core-tools/activator-and-sbt)
tutorials. They basically cover the same material as our [Getting
Started Guide](getting-started), but in a more interactive
environment.

The [first
tutorial](http://www.lightbend.com/activator/template/activator-longevity-tutorial)
implements a REST API with [Akka
HTTP](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4.8/scala/http/).

The [second
tutorial](http://www.lightbend.com/activator/template/activator-longevity-play-tutorial)
ports this original tutorial to
[Play](https://www.playframework.com/).
