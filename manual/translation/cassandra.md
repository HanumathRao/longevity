Every Cassandra table has at least two columns: A column named `p`,
which stores the [persistent object translated into JSON](json.html),
and a column named `id`, which stores a [primary key UUID](keys.html).

It [optimistic locking](../context/opt-lock.html) is turned on, then a
`modified_date` column is also added. This is a `text` column storing
the timestamp in a lossless [ISO
8061](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format with UTC time
zone.

More columns are added to support any [keys](../ptype/keys.html) or
[indexes](../ptype/indexes.html) for the [persistent
type](../ptype). Every [property](../ptype/properties.html) used in a
key or index is expanded in to a sequence of property components that
all have [basic types](../basics.html). These property components are
each stored in
[indexed](https://docs.datastax.com/en/cql/3.1/cql/cql_reference/create_index_r.html)
Cassandra columns. These columns all have names prefixed with `prop_`, 

The property component columns are used to back calls to
[Repo.retrieve](../repo/retrieve.html), as well as [query
retrievals](../repo/query.html). Please note that queries constructed
using properties that are not part of a longevity key or index [will
fail](../repo/cassandra-query-limits.html).

For those of you who are disappointed that your retrievals are not
backed by a Cassandra primary key, remember that this is not a
permanent state of affairs. Please see the section on [partition
keys](keys.html) for more details.

Cassandra table names are generated by [underscoring the
camel-cased](http://longevityframework.github.io/longevity/scaladocs/emblem-latest/index.html#emblem.stringUtil$@camelToUnderscore(name:String):String)
name of the persistent class.
