The persistent object is translated directly into a BSON document as
described in the earlier section [Persistent to JSON](json.html). Some
other persistence-related fields are added to the JSON. All these
fields are prefixed with an underscore (`_`). For this reason, we
**highly recommend against** writing [persistent
objects](../persistent) with members whose names start with an
underscore.

As of now, the only underscored-prefixed column that we add to the
BSON is `_id`, as described in the [previous section](keys.html). But
you can expect to see more in the future, such as `_rowVersion`,
`_createdDate`, `_createdBy`, `_modifiedDate`, `_modifiedBy`, and
`_schemaVersion`.

MongoDB collection names are generated by [underscoring the
camel-cased](http://longevityframework.github.io/longevity/scaladocs/emblem-latest/index.html#emblem.stringUtil$@camelToUnderscore(name:String):String)
name of the persistent class.

Longevity [keys](../ptype/keys.html) and
[indexes](../ptype/indexes.html) are translated directly into [MongoDB
indexes](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/indexes/). Mongo indexes for
longevity keys will be
[unique](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/index-unique/).
