While longevity is a Domain Driven Design framework, you don't need to
be an expert in DDD to use it. However, it will be very helpful if you
and your teammates have a basic understanding of some of the core
concepts of DDD when using longevity. While we highly recommend [Eric
Evans' seminal book on the
topic](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321125215/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321125215&linkCode=as2&tag=longevity-02-20&linkId=H6BVI2N7QYDHQWYU),
we provide a quick primer here on those concepts of DDD that are most
relevant to using longevity:

- [Ubiquitous Language](ubiquitous-language.html)
- Subdomains and Bounded Contexts
- Roots, Entities and Value Objects
