title: building your subdomain
layout: page

Your main task when working with longevity is building your
`Subdomain`. Once this is done, we provide you with persistence. Your
subdomain classes are the core of you application(s). The other
layers perform their individual functions while using the domain
classes fluidly.

<div class="blue-side-bar">

As we mentioned earlier, we hope to cover more than just persistence
in the future. But we want to get the persistence part right, first.

Our discussion on building subdomains breaks down as follows:

- [Kinds of Subdomains](kinds.html)
- [Aggregate Roots](roots.html)
- [Basic Properties](basics.html)
- [Collections](collections.html)
- [Shorthands](shorthands.html)
- [Shorthand Pools](shorthand-pools.html)
- [Where Not to Construct Your Shorthand Pools](where-not.html)
