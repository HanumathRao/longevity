<div class="blue-side-bar">

You may find it onerous to have to extend a longevity class in your
domain. In theory, we could remove this requirement entirely, but it
makes the typing work out a lot more cleanly. It's not terribly
harmful either, as both <code>Entity</code> and
<code>Root</code> are simply empty-bodied marker traits (as you
can see from the <a
href="http://longevityframework.github.io/longevity/scaladocs/longevity-latest/#longevity.subdomain.Root">scaladocs</a>).
