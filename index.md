<div class = "tagline">You do your domain, we do your persistence.</div>

Model your domain in the language and style of Domain Driven
Design. Implement it using Scala case classes and companion
objects. Pass us your subdomain, and we provide the
persistence. Persistence concerns, operations and data are abstracted
behind an elegant persistence API. We provide you with fully featured
repositories for [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) and
[Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/). We provide a suite of
integration tests to exercise your repositories against a real
database, as well as in-memory repositories for other tests.
