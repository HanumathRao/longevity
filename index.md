Longevity is gearing up for an MMP release!

I've been working on the [user manual](manual), and I think it's
looking really nice. I want to get an initial version of that out
before I go to release. I also have one more feature to include -
[optimistic
locking](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/84759552). I figure
it's an easy win for the effort I'll put in. The critical feature
after that is [ad-hoc aggregate
queries](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/100264584). I have
a [lot of stuff
after](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/epic/show/1769462) that that I
want to get in a 1.0 release, but the criticality of those features
tapers off, so people will actually be able to start using it real
soon.
