This project is still in early development. A [minimum marketable
product
(MMP)](http://www.romanpichler.com/blog/minimum-viable-product-and-minimal-marketable-product/)
\- that is, the earliest version suitable for your use - is coming soon! I just hit my 0.1 milestone,
and 0.2 - the MMP - has three stories in it. I plan to work through those three stories while I'm
writing the initial user doc. I can't make any promises about timing, but you can always [watch the board](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1231978), and I'll let you know when it's ready.

longevity currently contains three subprojects:

- **emblem** - a metaprogramming library for managing types and reflecting case classes
- **longevity** - a DDD persistence framework for Scala and MongoDB
- **musette** - a content resource management system

emblem is a utility library used by longevity, and you can think of
musette as a flagship project that makes use of longevity.
