#longevity

A Domain Driven Design persistence framework for Scala and NoSQL.

This project is still in early development. A [minimum marketable
product
(MMP)](http://www.romanpichler.com/blog/minimum-viable-product-and-minimal-marketable-product/)
\- that is, the earliest version suitable for your use - is coming soon! All the features are in.
We'd still like to do a little work on the [user manual](http://longevityframework.github.io/longevity/manual) before releasing.

longevity currently contains two subprojects:

- **emblem** - a metaprogramming library for managing types and reflecting case classes
- **longevity** - a DDD persistence framework for Scala and NoSQL
